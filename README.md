# DESCRIPTION

This is my final project of Fuzzy Logic Course in my college with teams. 

Its about classification a road level based on number of accidents, number of vehicles, number of victims using Fuzzy Possibility C Means in Python.

Fuzzy Possibilistics C Means (FPCM) is an algorithm developed from Fuzzy C Means (FCM) and Possibilistics C Means (PCM). 
To improve the sub-structure of the data, this method adopts two types of membership,  it is relative (fuzzy) and absolute (possibilistic) distinctiveness. The absolute membership matrix can reduce the impact of outliers.
